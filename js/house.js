//House Logic

// 'house'[] this will be placed into the var players to keep the dealt cards in one set of array.
var houseHand = players.house[hand()];

//loop through till the condition for dealer is true...
//first check players object => key => 'house' => value 'hand'
return houseHand;
//if, when the cards in play for 'house'[numOne + numTwo]  >= 17, dealer stands
houseHand(hand()) => {
	if (houseHand >= 17) {
		return; //do nothing; stand
} else {
		() => {
			
		}
		//hit a new card
		//add new card to house.hand(numOne + numTwo + numNew)
		
		//hit until the house hand is >= 17


}


//if, when the cards in play for 'house'[numOne + numTwo] < 17, dealer must draw one card and add to'house'[numOne + NumTwo + newNum] array.


//need a function that adds a new card into the players hand one at a time every time players hit
