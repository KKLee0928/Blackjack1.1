//House Logic

// 'house'[] this will be placed into the var players to keep the dealt cards in one set of array.


//loop through till the condition for dealer is true...
//first check players object => key => 'house' => value 'hand'
return players(hand())
//if, when the cards in play for 'house'[numOne + numTwo]  >= 17, dealer stands
if (house(hand() {
	
}))


//if, when the cards in play for 'house'[numOne + numTwo] < 17, dealer must draw one card and add to'house'[numOne + NumTwo + newNum] array.
